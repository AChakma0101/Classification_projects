### Project Title
**Understanding and Building a Non-Parametric Classification Model - Random Forest**

### Description
This project entails understanding the foundational concepts of **Random Forests** before building the model, tuning it and making predictions. It also involves exploring evaluation of the model/s using several evaluation techniques. The breast cancer dataset has been used throughout for demonstraion purposes and for implementation of Random Forest algorithm in scikit-learn. 

The breast cancer dataset is built into scikit-learn wherein each datapoint has measurements from an image of a breast mass and whether or not it's cancerous. The target is a 1d numpy array of 1's and 0's where 0 means malignant and 1 means benign. The goal is to use these measurements to predict if the mass is cancerous. 

### Files used
* The breast cancer dataset is built into scikit-learn.
