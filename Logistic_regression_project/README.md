### Project Title
**Building and Evaluation of Classification Model using Logistic Regression**

### Description
This project entails, at first, EDA (exploratory data analysis) of the Titanic dataset as well as the breast cancer dataset. In the Titanic dataset which is stored in a csv file, the Survived column is the target, and contains several other features. Feature engineering of one column is also necessitated. The Survived column is a list of 1's and 0's where 1 means the passenger survived and 0 means didn't survive. The remaining columns, called features, are the information about the passenger which are used to predict the target.

The breast cancer dataset is built into scikit-learn wherein each datapoint has measurements from an image of a breast mass and whether or not it's cancerous. The target is a 1d numpy array of 1's and 0's where 0 means malignant and 1 means benign. The goal is to use these measurements to predict if the mass is cancerous. 

There is necessary `code` to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing as wells as visualizing _descriptive statistics_.

Apart from building the model, tuning the model and making predictions, this project entails in-depth evaluation of the model/s using extensive metrics and evaluation techniques.
