### Project Title
**Building a Classification Model using KNN Algorithm and its Evaluation**

### Description
This project entails EDA (exploratory data analysis) of the iris dataset which is perhaps the best known dataset to be found in pattern recognition literature. There are 150 iris plants, each with 4 numeric attributes: sepal length in cm, sepal width in cm, petal length in cm, and petal width in cm. The task is to predict each plant as an iris-setosa, an iris-versicolor, or an iris-virginica based on these attributes. The model is built using classification-based k nearest neighbors algorithm. 

There is necessary `code` to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing as wells as visualizing _descriptive statistics_.

### Files used
* The dataset is stored in a [csv](https://sololearn.com/uploads/files/iris.csv) file.
