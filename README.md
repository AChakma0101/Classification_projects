### Date created
This project including the README file has been created on `22nd August 2023`.

### Description
This is a collection of several classification machine learning algorithms, both parametric as well as non-parametric, individually implemented using a host of different datasets. The classification machine learning algorithms demonstrated/implemented and model performance evaluated include the following:

* K-nearest Neighbors
* Logistic Regression
* Decistion Tree
* Random Forest
* Artificial Neural Network

### Different datasets used
* The Titanic dataset stored in a [csv](https://sololearn.com/uploads/files/titanic.csv) file.
* The breast cancer dataset built in scikit-learn.
* The iris dataset stored in a [csv](https://sololearn.com/uploads/files/iris.csv) file.
* Several artificial datasets including datasets from [OpenML](www.openml.org).
