### Project Title
**Understanding and Building a Non-Parametric Classification Model - Decision Tree**

### Description
This project entails, at first, understanding the Decision Tree terminology and its other foundations including metrics and interpretaion graphically as well as by exploration. The Titanic dataset has been used throughout for demonstration purposes and for implementation of Decisoin Tree algorithm in scikit-learn. In the Titanic dataset which is stored in a csv file, the Survived column is the target, and contains several other features. Feature engineering of one column is also necessitated. The Survived column is a list of 1's and 0's where 1 means the passenger survived and 0 means didn't survive. The remaining columns, called features, are the information about the passenger which are used to predict the target.

There is necessary `code` to import the data and class objects. Apart from building the model and making predictions, this project entails model/s evaluation using commonly used metrics and evaluation techniques.

### Files used
* The Titanic dataset is stored in a [csv](https://sololearn.com/uploads/files/titanic.csv) file.
