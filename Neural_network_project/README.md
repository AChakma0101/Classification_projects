### Project Title
**Understanding and Building a Neural Network Classification Model**

### Description
This project entails understanding the foundational concepts of **Artificial Neural Networks** before building the model, tuning it and making predictions. It also involves exploring evaluation of the model/s. Several artificial datasets including the dataset generated from MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) database of handwritten digits, datasets generated using _make_classification_ scikit-learn function and a granular version of the MNIST dataset from Open ML have been used throughout for demonstraion purposes and for implementation of MLPClassifier class in scikit-learn. 

### Files used
* MNIST database of handwritten digits
* [MNIST_784](www.openml.org)
